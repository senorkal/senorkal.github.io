 * Theme Support is used to make sure that your theme files are correct and updated, and also not to have to paste the same code in each theme.
 * This file is automatically imported if you are using one of Discord Addons themes.
 * It should work with all themes in the right Discord Addons GitHub repository.
 * You shouldn't import this file for your themes, unless you know exactly what you are doing.
